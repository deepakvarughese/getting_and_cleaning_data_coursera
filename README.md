# getting_and_cleaning_data_coursera


This file is a submission to the Getting and Cleaning Data Project in the JHU Data Science Course. In this data we looked at fitness data. 
We imported all the files from the test and training folders. We imported the file with the column names seperately. We imported the names of the activities seperately and the participant ID data seperately. We combined all this information to a single dataset. We then selected the columns that contained the mean and the sd. We greouped the data based on type of activity and calculated the mean for each activity for each participant. The data is in a tidy format.
